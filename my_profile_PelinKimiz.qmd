**Background of my top data science skills:** *I developed my strongest data science skills by exploring how data-driven insights can enhance the understanding of legal and social systems. My interest in data analytics began during my Internet Law course, where I became curious about how data is used to regulate and interpret online behavior. Since then, I have strengthened my skills through academic coursework, self-learning, and hands-on projects using R for data analysis and visualization.*

**Next things I want to learn in data science:** *I would like to deepen my knowledge of machine learning and its applications in law and social science. I am especially interested in learning how predictive models can be used to analyze patterns in legal data and support decision-making. Additionally, I want to improve my data storytelling and dashboard design skills to communicate complex findings more effectively.*
